# What's Next?

Now you have the foundational skills for working with Docker:
- Building images
- Running containers
- Managing volumes for persistence
- Orchestrating multiple services with Docker Compose

The next steps in your Docker journey might include:
- Deploying containers to production (using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
- Container orchestration at scale with Kubernetes
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Docker
- Docker security best practices
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images

But honestly? You already know enough to be productive with Docker in your day-to-day development. Go build something cool!
